# Geometric Generator (Web)
This was originally created as an electron app for MacOS and Windows in early 2020.
The primary goal of the project was to improve vanilla javascript understanding.

The Geometric Generator found it's way into client work through my employer, [Theorem](https://www.theorem.co/). We repurposed the generator (with different artwork) for use within design systems. The generator allowed clients to generate infinite and consistent artwork for product, marketing, and general purposes.

I've tested the output of the vector artwork in popular UI/vector editing programs (Figma, Sketch, and Adobe Illustrator). Each app interprets the vector artwork _slightly_ differently. However, all of generated artwork should at least be usable in those apps.
